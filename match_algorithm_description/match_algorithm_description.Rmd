\section{Introduction}\label{intro}

This document is part of a larger research project about software degradation caused by careless developers' behavior and strategies to deal with such undesired behavior. 
The strategies to deal with this problem will possibly be inspired by concepts from game theory. 
At this moment, we assume that software degradation can be measured by the number and the types of kludges made by software developers in the code. 
So, one of the goals of this project is to study how software projects evolve in terms of number and kinds of kludges. 
Right now, we are trying to identify kludges by looking at alerts generated by the PMD source code analyzer.

To evaluate how the number of alerts evolves throughout the history of a software project, we must be able to analyze two different versions of a source code module (an old and a new version) and categorize each alert contained in the new version as either **new**, **fixed** or **open**.

A PMD alert generated for the old version is either **open** or **fixed** in the new version. 
An **open** alert remains in the new version of the code. 
A **fixed** alert does not exist in the new version. 

A PMD alert generated for the new version is either **open** or **new**. 
An **open** alert indicates that the same alert was identified in the old version. 
A **new** alert implies that the same alert cannot be identified in the old version. 

The alerts identified as **open** are equivalent in both new and old versions. 
To decide whether an alert is **open**, **fixed** or **new**, one has to identify if an alert in the old version is equivalent to an alert in the new version. 
The intersection between **fixed** alerts, **new** alerts and **open** alerts is empty. 

In order to decide if an alert is **open**, **fixed** or **new**, we have to identify if an alert in the old version is equivalent to an alert in the new version. 
This document describes the algorithms we are using to make this classification.  

In Section \ref{pmd}, I describe how I use PMD source code analyzer in two tasks. 
The first task is to list the alerts that represent possible kludges. 
PMD receives a source code \textcolor{red}{(Prof Márcio, ele pode gerar alertas de um software inteiro, não só um conjunto, por isso tirei "module")} as input and generates a list of bad programming practices contained in the code. 
The process we follow to generate the alerts using PMD source code analyzer is discussed in Section \ref{pmd_alerts}. 
The other task for which we use PMD is in the creation of an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) from a source code with selected nodes. 
This will help us in one of the algorithms described in Section \ref{alg}. 
The creation of the AST using PMD is described in Section \ref{ast}.

In Section \ref{alg}, I describe two algorithms that categorize the alerts as **new**, **fixed** or **open**. 
The first one, described in Section \ref{alg1}, is a naive algorithm based on matches by lines of code and some key features of the alerts. 
The second is a more sophisticated algorithm, based on matches by blocks of code, using the Abstract Syntax Tree.


\section{PMD Source Code Analyzer}\label{pmd}

PMD is static source code analyzer that is commonly used to find possible programming flaws. 
In this work we use PMD for two tasks: generate alerts that we interpret as clues about kludges and create an AST from the source code with selected kinds of node.

\subsection{Using PMD to generate alerts}\label{pmd_alerts}

PMD traverses the AST of a source code searching for violations of rules that are configured by the user. 
PMD comes with a default rule set for Java language. 
The default rule set finds common programming flaws like unused variables, empty catch blocks, unnecessary object creation, and so forth. 
It´s possible configure a different set of rules creating a custom XML file. 
At this point we use the default rule set to generate the alerts that we interpret as kludges and try to categorize in Section \ref{alg}

\newpage

In Figure \ref{simple_code}, we can see an example of a simple code and the alerts that were generated by the default rule set of PMD alerts tool.

examples_sec2 <- tribble(
    
    ~name,                  ~path,                                                              ~output,

) %>% 
    mutate(id = row_number())


examples_sec2_executed <- examples_sec2 %>%
    mutate(pmd_command =
               map2(
                   .x = path,
                   .y = output,

                       rule_path = rule_path,
                       output_path = output_path,
                       output = .y

               )) %>%
    mutate(pmd_command_output = map(

```

\subsection{Using PMD to generate an Abstract Syntax Tree }\label{ast}

The AST is used, in conjunction with the relation between the lines we will see in Section \ref{map}, to understand the location of an alert in a version of a code. 
We use this information in the algorithm described in Section \ref{alg2}

PMD lets us configure our own rules. Figure \ref{pmd_designer_fig} shows the designer tool that helps a user to create custom rules.

![PMD Designer tool\label{pmd_designer_fig}](figures/pmddesigner.png)

We can see that the tool traverses the source code visiting many different kinds of elements. 
If we build our own simple rules, aimed only to capture some kinds of elements, we will generate list of "alerts" that will contain all the elements of the chosen kinds.

\newpage

In Figure \ref{ruleset}, we show an example of a ruleset that captures all the method declarations.

```{xml, code=read_lines("blockrules/extractblockrules.xml"), echo = TRUE }

```

![Custom ruleset for PMD alerts tool \label{ruleset}](figures/fake.png)


Table \ref{selected_nodes} shows the kinds of elements that were selected for the creation of an AST for the code in Figure \ref{simple_code}.


```{r}

map_rule_small <- tribble(
    
    ~rule,                              ~small_rule,

    "class_or_interface_type",          "class_type",

    "import_declaration",               "import",
    "method",                           "method",
    "name",                             "name",
    "package",                          "package",

    "variable_id",                      "var_id",
    "formal_parameter",                 "param",
    "formal_parameters",                "params",
    "annotation",                       "annotation",
    "block",                            "block",
    "statement",                        "statement",
    "if_statement",                     "if"

)



map_rule_small %>%
  arrange(
    rule
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    rule_number = row_number()
  ) %>%
  select(rule_number, rule) %>%
  kable(
    format = "latex",
    caption = "Kinds of elements selected\\label{selected_nodes}",
    escape = TRUE
  ) %>%
  kable_styling(
    font_size = 8,
    latex_options = c("hold_position", "striped")
  )
  


```


If we select the list in Table \ref{selected_nodes}, the simple code shown in this Section captures the elements shown in Table \ref{elements_captured}    


```{r}

nodes <- read_raw_ast_nodes(
  code_location = "C:/doutorado/AnaliseTwitter4j/match_algorithm_description/little-tree",
  output_location <-  "C:/doutorado/AnaliseTwitter4j/match_algorithm_description/oldblock.xml"
)

show_latex_raw_ast_nodes(nodes)


```


Table \ref{selected_nodes} contains the list and location of the elements of the AST. 
In order to recreate the AST, we must follow three steps:

1. Link each element $a$ to the set of elements $X$ that are fully located between the begin line / begin column and end line / end column of element $a$. 
We can construct a directed graph in which the elements are the nodes and the links are the edges. 
This is not a tree yet, because each node will have edges directed to all its descendants and not only its children in the AST.

2. Sort the nodes in the decreasing order of its number of children. 
The objective is to establish that, in a search through this graph, the first child chosen will be the one that is a child in the AST, and not only on this graph.

3. Proceed a deep-first search starting from the compilation unit node.

\newpage

After we follow these steps, we come up with the AST as we see in Figure \ref{AST}.


```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE,  out.width="100%", fig.width=12, fig.height=16, fig.cap="Abstract Syntax Tree \\label{AST}" }

graph_dfs_tree <- generate_ast_tree_from_raw_nodes(nodes)

show_ast(graph_dfs_tree)

nodes_ast <- graph_dfs_tree %>% as_tibble()




```

\section{Algorithms to categorize alerts}\label{alg}

\subsection{Matches by line of code}\label{alg1}

In this first algorithm, I match the lines of code of the old version with the lines of code of the new version using information from the output of git's diff command. 
When an alert with the same features occurs in both matched lines, this alert is declared **open**. 
The alerts that occur in a not matched line of the old version are declared *fixed* and the alerts located in a unmatched line of the new version are declared as **new**.

These are the steps of the algorithm:

1. Generate a list of alerts from each version (old and new) using PMD Alert (Section \ref{codes});
2. Generate the git diff between the two versions (Section \ref{diff});
3. Using information from git diff, create a map between the lines (Section \ref{map});
4. Categorize the alerts (Section \ref{categorize}).


\subsubsection{Generate a list of alerts for each version}\label{codes}




```{r execution of alerts and map, echo=FALSE  }


examples_executed <- examples %>%
    mutate(pmd_command =
               map2(
                   .x = path,
                   .y = output,
                   ~ assemble_pmd_command(
                       pmd_path = pmd_path,
                       code_path = .x ,
                       rule_path = rule_path,
                       output_path = output_path,
                       output = .y
                   )
               )) %>%
    mutate(pmd_command_output = map(
        .x = pmd_command,
        .f =  ~ shell(cmd = .x, shell = "PowerShell")
    )) %>%
    mutate(pmd_output = map(.x = str_glue("{output_path}{output}.xml"), .f = read_pmd_xml))


examples_crossed <- cross_versions(examples_executed) 


```


The two codes presented in this Section, named "new version" and "old version", are used in Sections \ref{diff}, \ref{map} and \ref{categorize} to describe the algorithm.

The old version, with the alerts generated by PMI, is shown in Figure \ref{old_example}.

\newpage

\blandscape


```{java code old, code=read_and_decorate_code_and_alerts("old/code.java", examples_executed$pmd_output[[1]], TRUE, 3), echo = TRUE, size = "footnotesize" }

```

![Example: old version\label{old_example}](figures/fake.png)


\elandscape

\newpage

Table \ref{alerts_old} lists the alerts found in the old version.

```{r  show alerts old, echo=FALSE }

examples_executed$pmd_output[[1]] %>% 
  select(
    id = id_alert,
    beginline,
    ruleset,
    rule,
    package,
    class,
    method,
    variable
  ) %>% 
  replace_na(
    list(
      method = "No method",
      variable = "No variable"
    )
  ) %>% 
  kable(
    caption = "Alerts in the old version\\label{alerts_old}",
  ) %>% 
  kable_styling(
    font_size = 6,  
    latex_options = c("hold_position")
  )
  


```


The new version, shown in Figure \ref{new_example}, has the alerts listed in Table \ref{alerts_new}.

```{r  show alerts new, echo=FALSE }

examples_executed$pmd_output[[2]] %>% 
  select(
    id = id_alert,
    beginline,
    ruleset,
    rule,  
    package,
    class,
    method,
    variable
  ) %>% 
  replace_na(
    list(
      method = "No method",
      variable = "No variable"
    )
  ) %>% 
  kable(
    caption = "Alerts in the new version\\label{alerts_new}",
  ) %>% 
  kable_styling(
    font_size = 6,
    latex_options = c("hold_position")
  )
  


```

By mapping the alerts in both version, we observe the following: 

* line 3 in the old version had a "Unused Import" which was removed in the new version. 
So, the alert related to this line must be declared **fixed**;

* line 63 in the old version (61 in the new version) was fixed by changing the name of the parameter. 
This must be classified as another **fixed** alert;

* line 89 was added to the new version and contains a unused private field. 
Such must be categorized as a **new** alert.

\subsubsection{Generate the git diff between the two versions}\label{diff}

The _git diff_ command is executed between two subsequent versions with the option --patience. 
The result of the _git diff_ operation between the versions presented in the last section is shown in Figure \ref{figure_diff}.


```{diff showing git diff,  code=readLines("old_original_new_1.diff"), echo=TRUE}


```

![Git diff between code in Figure \ref{old_example} and code in Figure \ref{new_example} \label{figure_diff} ](figures/fake.png)


\subsubsection{Using information from git diff, create a relation between the lines}\label{map}


For each difference stated in the output (the sections of the diff file starting with "@@"), there is an indication of the number of lines removed from the old version and the number of lines added to the new one.
The line in which the lines are removed from the old version and the line at which the lines are added is indicated, too.  
By using this information we create a relation between the lines of the old version and the equivalent lines in the new version.
For the new and old versions presented in Section \ref{codes}, the relation is shown in Table \ref{table_map}.


```{r showing map  }

examples_crossed$lines_map[[1]] %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  mutate(
    row = row_number(),
    na_mark = if_else(is.na(map_remove) | is.na(map_add), row , NA_integer_  ),
    next_na = na_mark,
    last_na = na_mark
  ) %>% 
  fill(
    next_na, .direction = "up"
  ) %>% 
  fill(
    last_na, .direction = "down"
  ) %>% 
  replace_na(
    list(
      last_na = 0,
      next_na = nrow(examples_crossed$lines_map[[1]]) + 1
    )
  ) %>%
  mutate(
    dist_next = next_na - row,
    dist_last = row - last_na + 0.1
  ) %>%
  rowwise() %>% 
  mutate(
    min_dist = min(dist_next, dist_last)
  ) %>% 
  filter(
    min_dist < 4
  ) %>%
  ungroup() %>% 
  mutate(    
    map_remove = 
      case_when(
        min_dist == 3.1 ~ str_glue("{lag(map_remove)+1}-"),
        min_dist == 3.0 ~ str_glue("-{lead(map_remove)-1}"),
        TRUE ~ map_remove %>% as.character()
      ),
    map_add = 
      case_when(
        min_dist == 3.1 ~ str_glue("{lag(map_add)+1}-"),
        min_dist == 3.0 ~ str_glue("-{lead(map_add)-1}"),
        TRUE ~ map_add %>% as.character()
      )
  ) %>% 
  select(old = map_remove, new = map_add) %>% 
  mutate(  
    old = if_else(is.na(old), str_glue("\\textcolor{{white}}{{{row_number()}}}"), old),
    new = if_else(is.na(new), str_glue("\\textcolor{{white}}{{{row_number()}}}"), new)
  ) %>% 
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = old,
    values_from = new,
    names_repair = "minimal"
  ) %>% 
  kable(
    caption = "Relation between lines of the old version and lines of the new version\\label{table_map}",
    escape = FALSE
  ) %>% 
  kable_styling(
    font_size = ,
    latex_options = c("scale_down")
  )

```

\blandscape


Now we can connect the two versions, as well as their alerts, as we see in Figure \ref{comparison}.



```{java showing codes, code=read_and_decorate_code_and_alerts_mapped("old/code.java", examples_executed$pmd_output[[1]], "new/code.java", examples_executed$pmd_output[[2]],examples_crossed$lines_map[[1]], TRUE, 3), echo=TRUE, size="tiny"  }

```

\newpage 

\subsubsection{Categorize the alerts}\label{categorize}

The alert in the old version is classified as **open** if there is an alert in the new version in the corresponding line with the same rule, same method name, and same variable name. 
The associated rule, the name of the method and variable affected by the alert are provided by PMD as part of the description of the alert. 
Otherwise, the alert is categorized as **fixed**.

\textcolor{red}{Table \ref{class_old}} shows the classification of the alerts in the old version. 
For alerts 1 and 4, it is not possible to find an alert with the same rule, method and variable name in the related line of code in the new version. 
So, these alerts are classified as **fixed**. 

For the remaining alerts, it is possible to find an alert with the same rule, method and variable name in the related line of code in the new version. 
So, these alerts are classified as **open**.

\textcolor{red}{Marcio: referenciar as tabelas 4 e 5 no corpo do texto.}
\textcolor{red}{Bruno: Tá referenciado, não? Botei em vermelho.}



```{r executing classifications, echo=FALSE}

classifications <- categorise_alerts(
  map = examples_crossed$lines_map[[1]], 
  alerts_old = examples_executed$pmd_output[[1]],
  alerts_new = examples_executed$pmd_output[[2]]
  ) 


```


```{r}

    class = class_old,
    method = method_old,
    variable = variable_old,
    idnew = id_alert_new,
    linenew = line_new, 
    category = classification
  ) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  mutate_if(
    is.character,
    ~str_replace_all(.x, "\\_", "\\\\_") 
  )

classifications_to_show %>% 
  mutate(
    category = cell_spec(x = category, format = "latex", color = if_else(category == "Fixed", "darkgreen", "darkred"))
  ) %>%
  kable(

    escape = FALSE,
    booktabs = TRUE,
    linesep = ""
  ) %>%
  kable_styling(
    font_size = 6,
    latex_options = c("hold_position", "striped")
  )
  
  


```


\textcolor{red}{Table \ref{class_new}} shows the classification of the alerts in the new version. 
The alert 8 is the only one for which there is no alert with the same characteristics in a line of the old version that is mapped to the original line in the new version. 
So it is the only **new** alert.



```{r}

\subsection{Matches using the Abstract Syntax Tree and the relation between lines of code of the versions}\label{alg2}


In this algorithm we use the AST to infer if the alerts in different versions must be considered the same

We will consider the old version in Figure \ref{old_simple_code} and the new version in Figure \ref{new_simple_code}


\newpage

```{java code old version, code=read_and_decorate_code_and_alerts("little-tree/code.java", examples_sec2_executed$pmd_output[[1]], FALSE, 10), echo = TRUE }

```


![Old version  \label{old_simple_code}](figures/fake.png)

\newpage

```{java code new version, code=read_and_decorate_code_and_alerts("little-tree-new/code.java", examples_sec2_executed$pmd_output[[2]], FALSE, 10), echo = TRUE }

```


![New version  \label{new_simple_code}](figures/fake.png)



In Figure \ref{AST_compare} we can see the comparison between the two ASTs.

We define that a node from an AST is equivalent to a node of the AST of the subsequent version if:

- Considering the relation between the lines of the two versions constructed as we saw in Section \ref{map}, the nodes in both trees begin and end in related lines

- The nodes are of the same kind


In Figure \ref{AST_groups} we can see both ASTs. The nodes with the same numbers inside the nodes are equivalent 



```{r , echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE,  out.width="100%", fig.width=12, fig.height=8, fig.cap="Abstract Syntax Tree \\label{AST_groups}", fig.pos="H"}

  show_label = TRUE, 
  alpha_label = 0, 
  node_text_field = "id_group" 
)


chart_graph_old + chart_graph_new



```



In Figure \ref{AST_with_alerts} we add the alerts that are related with nodes in the AST.

The path between the alert and the root of the AST can be seen in \ref{AST_alert_1}


```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE,  out.width="100%", fig.width=12, fig.height=6, fig.cap="Abstract Syntax Tree \\label{AST_alert_1}", fig.pos="H"}



nodes_path_from_alert <- function(graph, id_node){
  output <- graph %>% 
    convert(to_shortest_path , from = id_node, to = 1  , mode = "out" ) %>%
    activate(nodes) %>% 
    as_tibble() %>% 
    select(id_group)
}

graph_path_from_alert <- function(graph, id_node){
  output <- graph %>% 
    convert(to_shortest_path , from = id_node, to = 1  , mode = "out" ) 
}


graph_old_reverted <- graph_old_with_alert %>%

  reroute(from = to, to = from)

nodes_alerts_old <- graph_old_reverted %>%

  filter(!is.na(id_alert_alert)) %>% 
  select(id_alert) %>% 
  as_tibble()

graphs_from_alerts_old <- nodes_alerts_old %>% 
  mutate(graph = map(.x = id_alert, .f = ~graph_path_from_alert(graph = graph_old_reverted, id_node = .x )   )) 


show_ast(graphs_from_alerts_old$graph[[1]], size_label = 4)

graphs_from_alerts_old %<>% rename(
  id_alert_old = id_alert,
  graph_old = graph
) 



```



The algorithm generates some features for each pair of alerts $(n,o)$ with one element $n$ coming from the old version and one element $o$ coming from the new version.

Even though it's not possible to be sure that a pair of elements refer to the same alert, we think that these features can provide some clues. 

This group of features can be an input to a heuristic or a machine learning tool that can decide if the alerts are the same.

We propose the following list of features:

* Same Group ID: a boolean indicator that tells if the alerts are equivalent as defined in Figure \ref{AST_groups}

* Same Method: a boolean indicator that tells if the alerts belong to the same method. We know the alert's method following the path from the alert´s node to the root. The first node of the kind "method" found in this path defines the alert's method. If this is the same for $o$ and for $n$, then they belong to the same method.

* Same Block: a boolean indicator that show if the $o$ and $n$ belong to the same block. It is defined the same way the "Same method" indicator is defined.

* Line distance: $o$ and $n$ have a begin line $b(o)$ and $b(n)$ and an end line $e(n)$ and $e(n)$. Line distance is $abs(mean(b(o), e(o)) - mean(b(n), e(n)))$

* Normalized line distance: this is the line distance but normalized by the size of the last common node.
